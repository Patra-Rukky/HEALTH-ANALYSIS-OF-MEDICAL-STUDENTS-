for the analysia process, i first started with cleading the data
Data Type: I first changed the columns to the correct data types by using number format on the columns with numerical data. 
BLANKS -this data came with a lot of blanks that needed to be filled in.
-for the first column which was the student id, I noticed it was numbered 1 – 200000. Because of that, I created a new column and numbered it as usual from 1- 200000 using flash fill. Then, I deleted the original column that came with the data set.
-for the numerical column, I calculated the average and used that to fill in the blank spaces 
-for the gender and blood type column, I used the most occurring values which were female and o respectively
-for the last two columns which were yes or no answers, I used no specified to fill in the columns.
